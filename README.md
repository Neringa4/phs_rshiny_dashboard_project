# Public Health Scotland group project - PDA

Personal Development Award evidence for Scottish Qualifications Authority

## Background

With data provided open source from the National Health Service (NHS) on areas not exhaustive of admissions demographic, type of admissions and bedspace, we have been tasked with developing and employing an interactive dashboard displaying this information. 

The overarching theme is to display the effect winter had on the health service in the year 2020, with an output to forecast the now retrospective winter of 2021. Considerations on the COVID-19 pandemic will be made along with the media's prediction of the "winter crisis" at that time.

## Languages/Technology 

This project will use R with R Studios, along with Git/Git Hub for version control.
